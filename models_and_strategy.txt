Models and Modeling Strategy
===========================

This document outlines the key models to be developed for the Quick Commerce MFU project, the strategy for each, the datasets to be used, and the rationale/steps for implementation. The approach is informed by EDA insights, project goals, and best practices from industry and research.

------------------------------------------------------------

1. Demand Forecasting Models
----------------------------
**Goal:** Predict order volume or sales per area, time slot, product, or store to optimize MFU pre-stocking and resource allocation.

- **Datasets:**
  - Instacart: For user/product/area-level demand patterns
  - M5 Walmart: For time-series sales forecasting at store/department/product level
- **Modeling Strategy:**
  - Use time-series models (ARIMA, Prophet, Exponential Smoothing) for baseline forecasts
  - Use machine learning models (Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM) for feature-rich forecasting
  - For deep learning, consider LSTM/GRU or Temporal Fusion Transformer for complex seasonality
  - Incorporate time-based, product-based, and user/store-based features
  - Include holiday, promotion, and weather features where available
  - Evaluate using RMSE/MAE and time-based cross-validation
- **Steps:**
  1. Aggregate demand/sales by desired granularity (area, time, product, store)
  2. Engineer lag, rolling, and holiday features
  3. Train/test split using time-based validation
  4. Model selection and hyperparameter tuning
  5. Forecast and evaluate

------------------------------------------------------------

2. Delivery Optimization & Simulation Models
-------------------------------------------
**Goal:** Optimize MFU routing, order batching, and delivery scheduling to minimize cost, time, and carbon footprint.

- **Datasets:**
  - Instacart: For order locations, timing, and clustering
  - M5 Walmart: For demand patterns and store-level constraints
- **Modeling Strategy:**
  - Use clustering algorithms (K-Means, DBSCAN) to define delivery zones and MFU clusters
  - Use optimization algorithms (Linear Programming, Genetic Algorithms, Simulated Annealing) for route and batch assignment
  - Simulate traditional vs. MFU-based delivery using demand forecasts and real-world constraints
  - Evaluate using delivery time, cost, and efficiency metrics
- **Steps:**
  1. Cluster orders by location/time for MFU assignment
  2. Batch orders for efficient delivery
  3. Optimize MFU routes using TSP/VRP solvers
  4. Simulate and compare delivery models

------------------------------------------------------------

3. Customer Segmentation & Personalization
------------------------------------------
**Goal:** Identify customer segments for targeted marketing, recommendations, and personalized service.

- **Datasets:**
  - Instacart: For user purchase history, basket composition, and behavior
- **Modeling Strategy:**
  - Use unsupervised learning (K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering, DBSCAN) on user-product/category matrices
  - Use PCA/t-SNE for dimensionality reduction and visualization
  - Analyze clusters for actionable segments (e.g., loyalists, bulk buyers, new parents)
  - Use segments for targeted recommendations and offers
- **Steps:**
  1. Aggregate user purchase data by product/category
  2. Reduce dimensionality (PCA)
  3. Cluster users and interpret segments
  4. Integrate segments into downstream models

------------------------------------------------------------

4. Market Basket Analysis & Recommendation
-----------------------------------------
**Goal:** Discover product affinities and build recommender systems to increase basket size and customer satisfaction.

- **Datasets:**
  - Instacart: For order-product relationships
- **Modeling Strategy:**
  - Use association rule mining (Apriori, FP-Growth) to find frequent itemsets and rules
  - Calculate support, confidence, and lift for product pairs
  - Build collaborative filtering or content-based recommenders for next-product prediction
- **Steps:**
  1. Prepare transaction data (order-product matrix)
  2. Run association rule mining
  3. Build and evaluate recommender models

------------------------------------------------------------

5. Inventory & Restocking Optimization
--------------------------------------
**Goal:** Optimize MFU and store inventory levels and restocking schedules based on demand forecasts.

- **Datasets:**
  - Both Instacart and M5 Walmart (for demand and sales patterns)
- **Modeling Strategy:**
  - Use demand forecasts to drive inventory planning
  - Apply inventory optimization models (EOQ, Newsvendor, simulation-based)
  - Integrate with MFU routing and restocking simulation
- **Steps:**
  1. Forecast demand at MFU/store level
  2. Calculate optimal inventory and reorder points
  3. Simulate restocking and evaluate service levels

------------------------------------------------------------

6. Feedback & Service Quality Analysis
--------------------------------------
**Goal:** Link delivery/service metrics to customer feedback and satisfaction.

- **Datasets:**
  - Instacart (if feedback data available)
- **Modeling Strategy:**
  - Use regression or classification models to predict feedback scores from delivery features
  - Analyze drivers of satisfaction and areas for improvement
- **Steps:**
  1. Merge feedback with delivery/order data
  2. Feature engineering (timeliness, accuracy, etc.)
  3. Model feedback as regression/classification

------------------------------------------------------------

7. Marketing Performance Attribution
------------------------------------
**Goal:** Quantify the impact of marketing campaigns on orders and delivery performance.

- **Datasets:**
  - Instacart (if marketing data available)
- **Modeling Strategy:**
  - Use uplift modeling, regression, or causal inference to estimate campaign effects
  - Segment analysis for targeted marketing
- **Steps:**
  1. Merge marketing and order data
  2. Feature engineering (campaign, timing, user segment)
  3. Model and interpret impact

------------------------------------------------------------

**General Modeling Best Practices:**
- Use time-based cross-validation for all time series and forecasting models
- Feature engineering is critical: leverage time, user/store, product, and external data
- Address class imbalance and outliers as needed
- Use interpretable models for business-critical decisions, and ensemble/deep models for accuracy
- Validate models with both offline metrics and, where possible, online/real-world experiments
