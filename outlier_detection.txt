Outlier Detection Report
========================

This report summarizes the outlier detection process for both the Instacart and M5 Walmart datasets, including the method used, columns analyzed, number and percentage of outliers, and calculation details.

------------------------------------------------------------

Instacart Dataset
-----------------
- **Column analyzed:** add_to_cart_order (the position of a product in the cart for each order)
- **Outlier detection method:** IQR (Interquartile Range) Rule
    - Outliers are defined as values less than Q1 - 1.5×IQR or greater than Q3 + 1.5×IQR
    - Q1 (25th percentile) and Q3 (75th percentile) are calculated from the data
    - IQR = Q3 - Q1
    - Lower bound = Q1 - 1.5×IQR
    - Upper bound = Q3 + 1.5×IQR
- **Number of outliers detected:** ~1,357,124
- **Total records analyzed:** 32,434,489
- **Percentage of outliers:** ~4.18%
- **Interpretation:**
    - Outliers represent unusually high or low positions in the cart sequence. High values may indicate bulk orders or rare user behavior, while low values (below 1) are likely errors.
    - Outliers were not removed at this stage; they may be revisited if they impact modeling.

M5 Walmart Dataset
------------------
- **Column analyzed:** Weekly_Sales (weekly sales for each store and department)
- **Outlier detection method:** IQR (Interquartile Range) Rule
    - Outliers are defined as values less than Q1 - 1.5×IQR or greater than Q3 + 1.5×IQR
    - Q1 (25th percentile) and Q3 (75th percentile) are calculated from the data
    - IQR = Q3 - Q1
    - Lower bound = Q1 - 1.5×IQR ≈ -25,109.65
    - Upper bound = Q3 + 1.5×IQR ≈ 47,395.16
- **Number of outliers detected:** 35,521
- **Total records analyzed:** 421,570
- **Percentage of outliers:** 8.43%
- **Interpretation:**
    - Outliers include very high or low weekly sales, which may be due to real business events (e.g., holidays, promotions) or data corrections (e.g., negative sales).
    - Outliers were not removed at this stage; they may be revisited if they impact modeling.

**Note:**
- Outlier detection was performed using the IQR rule, a standard statistical method for identifying extreme values in a distribution.
- Visualizations (boxplots and histograms) were also generated for both columns to aid in understanding the distribution and presence of outliers.
- Outliers are retained for now and will be reconsidered if they negatively affect model performance or analysis.
