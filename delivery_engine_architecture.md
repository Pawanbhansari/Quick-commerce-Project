## Data Flow Architecture

```
Orders → Order Batching → Route Optimization → MFU Assignment → Delivery Execution
   ↓           ↓              ↓                ↓              ↓
Google Maps APIs: Geocoding → Distance Matrix → Directions → Real-time Tracking
```

### Step-by-Step Process:

1. **Order Ingestion**
   - Receive orders with delivery addresses
   - Geocode addresses to coordinates
   - Validate delivery locations

2. **Order Batching**

   - Group by time windows
   - Check MFU capacity constraints

3. **Route Optimization**
   - Calculate optimal routes (Directions API)
   - Consider traffic conditions
   - Balance MFU loads

4. **MFU Assignment**
